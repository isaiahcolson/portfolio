# Isaiah Colson - Portfolio
Here is my portfolio built in July 2020. You can view the working site [here](https://www.isaiahcolson.com/).



## Process/ Approach

1. I started my portfolio by finding some design references and inspiration. I assembled a few sites that I could use as a guide if I got stuck.

2. I then approached designing process by building out a color palette, here is an image of what I wanted to use and how I wanted to use it.
<!-- TODO add image of color palette -->

3. After I knew my color palette, I created a few references of how to use the colors together as backgrounds, buttons, etc...
<!-- TODO add design reference images -->

4. Now that I had some personal guidelines, I was able to set the layout of the site with a wireframe. I started with a low fidelity layout and then created a high fidelity. With a clear look at how I wanted the site to look, I was able to easily add and style all sections of my portfolio in a fration of the time.
<!-- TODO add wireframes -->

5. I began writing code after my wireframes were complete. This was a difficult process because there were some items that looked good on my wireframe that did not look good actualized. If I did come to any blocks creatively, I would revert back to my wireframe and solve creative issues there. This allowed me to easily move and place elements in Figma as opposed to writing in code and guessing.

6. Once my site was complete locally, I pushed my code to my hosting platform and made my site live.

7. While I did have a working site, there were (and still are) some things I wanted to add and improve. I started by making my site responsive so I could easily send this to people or show them if I were out and about. I continue to make improvements and updates to my site.
